  ### I am an Emergency Veterinarian.

   I LOVE being a veterinarian and have multiple publications in veterinary journals and many years in the field. As a pet owner of two rescue dogs, I understand that pet parenthood can sometimes be a struggle. I have first-hand experience with various problems dogs and cats may face. On my days off, I love going hiking or mountain biking with my dogs and my husband. Please let me know how I can help your furry friend!
